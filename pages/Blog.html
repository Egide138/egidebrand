           <p> It hurts to be hurt—repeatedly! But consider this: “When people hurt you over and over, think of 
            them like sand paper. They may scratch and hurt you a bit, but in the end, you end up polished and 
            they end up useless” (Chris Colfer, actor).
            
            Incredible though it may seem, God often employs the hurtful actions of people to bless us! 
            He uses them like abrasive or coarse “sand paper,” to polish or “smooth off the rough spots” in our live
            s. Think of the envy & betrayal of Joseph’s brothers, the lies & slander of Potiphar’s wife, and the forge
            tfulness of the chief-cupbearer. Amazingly, God used these hurtful actions to prepare and promote 
            Joseph to become prime minister (Genesis 39-41)!
            
            Are you wondering about the prickly, mean, and vicious people who keep showing up in your life?
             They’re providential sand papers. Be polished by them! God uses even the worst people to bring out
             the best in us. Shine through your hurts!</p>
